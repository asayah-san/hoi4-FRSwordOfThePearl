## Sword of the Pearl
### A FÃ¼hrerreich Submod

This submod gives South-East Asia some flavour adding a focus tree, events, and etc for the Philippine Commonwealth.

The events and focus tree also gives the user choice for a path. The Philippines can go Democratic (SocDem, MarketLib, Conservative) or Reactionary (AuthDem and NatPop and Valkism). There is also an option to side with different Major Countries, such as Britain, Japan, USA and Germany or create an OP faction with neighboring Asian countries.
